如何屏蔽中英文切换ctrl+space

URL: https://superuser.com/questions/327479/ctrl-space-always-toggles-chinese-ime-windows-7


I've been aware of this Windows bug for years. After tons of unsatisfying workarounds and fruitless searching the one or two times a year I attempt to find a solution, I finally have it!

Procedure
	Go to Start > Type in regedit and start it
	Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/Input Method/Hot Keys
	Select the key named:
		00000070 for the Chinese (Traditional) IME - Ime/NonIme Toggle hotkey
		00000010 for the Chinese (Simplified) IME - Ime/NonIme Toggle hotkey
		
	In the right sub-window, there are three subkeys.
	Key Modifiers designate Alt/Ctrl/Shift/etc and is set to Ctrl (02c00000).
	Virtual Key designates the finishing key and is set to Space (20000000).
	
	Change the first byte in Key Modifiers from 02 to 00
	Change the first byte in Virtual Key from 20 to FF
	
	Log off and log back on. I don't think it's necessary to restart.
	Do not change the Hot keys for input languages in Control Panel, unless you want to do this all over again.
	这句话不对,需要重启生效

Notes: Symptoms
	Each registry key (thing that looks like a folder) is for each specific hotkey setting that you would normally find in Control Panel > Region and Language > Keyboards and Languages > Change keyboards... > Advanced Key Settings > Hot keys for input languages.
	The recurring bug is the hotkey being automatically reset to Ctrl+space even if changed via the GUI.
